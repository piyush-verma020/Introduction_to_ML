    "### Types of Machine Learning system\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ***Supervised Learning***\n",
    "\n",
    "   In `Supervised Learning` the training set you feed to the algorithm includes the desired solutions, called `labels`. A typical supervised learning  task is classidication. For example a spam filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ***Unsupervised Learning***\n",
    "\n",
    "    In `Unsupervised Learning` the training set you feed to the algorithm is unlabeled. The system tries to learn without a teacher. For explae, say you have a lot og data about your blog's visitors and you might want to run a clustering algorithm which basically detects the groups of similar visitors for example you grouped you visitor's with respect to age or anything else.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ***Semi-supervised Learning***\n",
    "\n",
    "    Since labeling dats is time-consuming and costly you will often have plenty of unlabeled instances, and few labeled instances. Some algorithms can deal with data that's partially labeled. This is called `semi-supervised learning`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. ***Self-supervised Learning***\n",
    "\n",
    "   Another approach to machine learning involves actually generating a fully labeled dataset from a fully unlabeled one. Again, once the whole dataset is labeled any supervised learning algorithm can be used. This approach is called `self-supervised`.\n",

    "### Batch Learning vs Online Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Batch Learning`\n",
    "\n",
    "      * Train on the whole dataset at once (or in fixed-size batches).\n",
    "\n",
    "      * When new data comes in, you usually retrain from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "      * Example: Standard LinearRegression in scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Online Learning`\n",
    "\n",
    "      * Train in small steps as data arrives (mini-batches or even one sample at a time).\n",
    "\n",
    "      * Uses methods like partial_fit().\n",
    "\n",
    "      * Keeps the knowledge from before.\n",
    "\n",
    "      * Example: SGDClassifier, Perceptron, MiniBatchKMeans.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Think of online learning like playing Mario. Imagine the game has many levels. Normally,say if you die at level 20, you might have to restart all the way from level 1. That’s like batch learning — it always trains from the beginning with all the data.***\n",
    "\n",
    "***But with online learning `(using partial_fit)`, it’s different. If you die at level 20, you don’t need to start over from level 1. Instead, you can continue training from level 20 itself, using the new data you just received. In other words, the model keeps building on what it already knows, instead of starting fresh every time. It's more like a checkpoint but for every new data received online***\n",
