ðŸ“˜ Scikit-Learn Notes & Practice

This repository contains my personal notes, code snippets, and practice exercises while learning Scikit-Learn, one of the most popular Machine Learning libraries in Python.

The goal of this repo is to:

* Document key concepts in ML workflows using Scikit-Learn.

* Provide quick reference code snippets for common tasks.

* Build a foundation for applying ML to real datasets.

ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

* 001_Notes_Scikit_Learn.ipynb â†’ Practical notes with examples and function usage.

* Notes_ML.ipynb â†’ Conceptual notes covering ML basics and algorithms.

ðŸš€ Topics Covered

* Data preprocessing

  * Train/Test split

  * Scaling, Normalization, Encoding

* Model building

  * Linear Regression, Logistic Regression

  * Decision Trees, Random Forests

* Model evaluation

  * Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, Confusion Matrix

* Pipelines & GridSearchCV

* Hands-on practice with small datasets

ðŸ“– How to Use

* Browse through the notebooks in order.

* Run the cells and experiment by changing parameters.

* Use these notes as a reference guide while working on ML projects.

ðŸ”® Future Plans

* Add real-world datasets for end-to-end demos.

* More algorithms (SVM, KNN, Gradient Boosting, etc.).

* Expanded explanations + visualizations.
